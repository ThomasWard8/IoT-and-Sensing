# IoT-and-Sensing
Designed for the DE4 module IoT and Sensing, this repository includes a Garmin app, Firebase functions and associated webapp

The webapp can be accessed at: (https://rise-4543c.web.app/)

The coursework video can be accessed at: (https://www.youtube.com/@thomasward7203)

I will aim to continue to run the garmin app overnight so that the displays can be seen on the webapp during the marking process.
